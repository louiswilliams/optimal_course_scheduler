optimal_course_scheduler
========================

Functioning development site: http://extrakt.us.to/

A Ruby on Rails app to create an optimal schedule for a semester of courses.

The "/data" folder contains scripts to add JSON files containing course and sections datato the development database.
This also contains said JSON files.

Look at the database migrations in "/db/migrate/" for columns and data types for each model. The parse_json.rb file in "/data" maps the JSON fields to the table fields.
